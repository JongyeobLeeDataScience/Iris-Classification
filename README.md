# Iris Classification

## Goals
Use Python's Iris Dataset to explore different classification models and determine the optimal model using confusion matrix

## Models
To determine the best classification model, the following models are studied

    1. Decision Tree; 
    2. Random Forest; 
    3. K-Nearest Classifier.
